<p id="description">This was the final React project from The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The main goal of this project was to build a fake e-commerce store using React and more specifically, react-router-dom. The fake store website consists of three main parts: Home, Catalogue, an "about" Product section and a Shopping Cart to display the items the user would like to purchase.</p>
